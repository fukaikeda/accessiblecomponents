                    adding info in the voiceover.

                    it has no interaction. It also had a popup that would provide no context, so I added a pop-up that would
                    tell the user how to inteact with the search bar. The removal of the clickable search button would also
                    not confuse users using a screenreader with a empty button.

        <div class="section" id="reflections">
            <p class="highlight">Reflections</p>
            <p class="paragraph">From this review, we can take away key points. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Overall Notes</b><br>
            - Some components, such as Messages, was really good about providing enough context within the voice over to allow
            a user to inteact with it with no visual component. I tried to replicate this in my design in a component which
            did not have such a good voiceover context. <br>
            <br>
            - However, I failed to account how the added feature would interact with a keyboard-focused user. It takes away a button that
            was meaningless in feature, but when the pop-up was added, there is difficulty in figuring out
            where exactly the user would have to tab to to see the popup. <br>
            <br>
            - Kat Holmes, a designer, mentioned disabilities as 'mismatches' of a user's bodies and an environment. 
            In my design, we strive to solve a mismatch between a user unable to navigate a search bar because of not
            knowing what to search by having a popup that is screen-accessibile to describe how to use it. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Other Specific Notes</b><br>
            - One example of how the tab input changes experiences negatively for users with imparements positively is that it makes
            the process very slow. Shortcuts changes experiences positivety in the way that it is much quicker, but it should not be forgotten that there is a large learning curve to this. <br>
            <br>
            - In the context of accesibility features, I do think voice over features are prioritized. This is both a positive and negative thing
            as since voice overs have so many plugs-in for users to use, the actual building of the website isn't considering this audience enough.
            This includes including lots of images and leaving alt text tags, but forgetting that the alt text tags
            are not enough for a visually impared user to fully understand what is happening. <br>
